Vaccination monitoring of India with QGIS
India – Highly populated developing nation with 1.4 billion people. India is highly prone to communicable diseases and tracking them is very important. 
Vaccination has been instrumental in eradicating communicable diseases in India. At present Indian government’s vaccination program provides immunization to 12 diseases and almost successfully prevented many infectious diseases from turning in to a disaster.
Geographic Information Systems (GIS) help to analyze the health patterns by integrating spatial data. It is vital in public health planning, outbreak detection, and vaccination tracking.
Problem: 

It is also important to closely monitor the vaccination rate in highly populated country to ensure the success rate in preventing communicable diseases.
Fragmented and underutilized health data in India, lack of geospatial analysis tools.

Solution:

Develop a GIS-based platform for disease mapping and trend analysis.
Integrate demographic and health data.
But by using QGIS platform, choropleth map of the vaccination rate can be plotted and the program can be monitored.

. Geographic Disparities: It addresses regional disparities in healthcare access and immunization by visualizing district-level vaccination rates and disease burdens.

2. Decision-making & Policy Support: The GIS-based tool provides actionable insights to policymakers and healthcare providers, enabling more targeted interventions and resource allocation.

3. Real-time Surveillance: Incorporating dashboards for real-time monitoring enhances outbreak preparedness and response.
4. Equity in Health Access: Highlights vulnerable areas, especially rural and urban slums, facilitating equity-based public health initiatives.
